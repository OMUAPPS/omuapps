We will also do our best to maintain [framework support](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/frameworks-feature-support) for all of the officially supported frameworks.\n\n## Contents\n\nStorybook essentials includes the following addons. Addons can be disabled and re-configured as [described below](#configuration):\n\n- [Actions](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/actions)\n- [Backgrounds](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/backgrounds)\n- [Controls](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/controls)\n- [Docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/docs)\n- [Viewport](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/viewport)\n- [Toolbars](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/toolbars)\n- [Measure](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/measure)\n- [Outline](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/addons/outline)\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can add Essentials to your project with:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev @storybook/addon-essentials\n```\n\nAnd then add the following line to your `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  addons: ['@storybook/addon-essentials'],\n};\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nEssentials is \"zero config.\" That means that comes with a recommended configuration out of the box.\n\nIf you want to reconfigure an addon, simply install that addon per that addon's installation instructions and configure it as normal. Essentials scans your project's `main.js` on startup and if detects one of its addons is already configured in the `addons` field, it will skip that addon's configuration entirely.\n\n## Disabling addons\n\nYou can disable any of Essential's addons using the following configuration scheme in `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  addons: [{\n    name: '@storybook/addon-essentials',\n    options: {\n      <addon-key>: false,\n    }\n  }]\n};\n```\n\nValid addon keys include: `actions`, `backgrounds`, `controls`, `docs`, `viewport`, `toolbars`.\n"},{"name":"@storybook/addon-interactions@8.0.4","repository":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook","license":"MIT","licenseText":"# Storybook Addon Interactions\n\nStorybook Addon Interactions enables visual debugging of interactions and tests in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).\n\n![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/321738/135628189-3d101cba-50bc-49dc-bba0-776586fedaf3.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall this addon by adding the `@storybook/addon-interactions` dependency:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D @storybook/addon-interactions @storybook/test\n```\n\nwithin `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  addons: ['@storybook/addon-interactions'],\n};\n```\n\nNote that `@storybook/addon-interactions` must be listed **after** `@storybook/addon-actions` or `@storybook/addon-essentials`.\n\n## Usage\n\nInteractions relies on \"instrumented\" versions of Vitest and Testing Library, that you import from `@storybook/test` instead of their original package. You can then use these libraries in your `play` function.\n\n```js\nimport { Button } from './Button';\nimport { within, userEvent, expect, fn } from '@storybook/test';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Button',\n  component: Button,\n  args: {\n    onClick: fn(),\n  },\n};\n\nconst Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;\n\nexport const Demo = Template.bind({});\nDemo.play = async ({ args, canvasElement }) => {\n  const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n  await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n  await expect(args.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();\n};\n```\n\nIn order to enable step-through debugging in the addon panel, calls to `userEvent.*`, `fireEvent`, `findBy*`, `waitFor*` and `expect` have to\nbe `await`-ed. While debugging, these functions return a Promise that won't resolve until you continue to the next step.\n\nWhile you can technically use `screen`, it's recommended to use `within(canvasElement)`. Besides giving you a better error\nmessage when a DOM element can't be found, it will also ensure your play function is compatible with Storybook Docs.\n\nNote that the `fn` function will assign a spy to your arg, so that you can assert invocations.\n"},{"name":"@storybook/addon-links@8.0.4","repository":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook","license":"MIT","licenseText":"# Story Links Addon\n\nThe Storybook Links addon can be used to create links that navigate between stories in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).\n\n[Framework Support](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/frameworks-feature-support)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall this addon by adding the `@storybook/addon-links` dependency:\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D @storybook/addon-links\n```\n\nwithin `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links'],\n};\n```\n\nThen you can import `linkTo` in your stories and use like this:\n\n```js\nimport { linkTo } from '@storybook/addon-links';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Button',\n};\n\nexport const first = () => <button onClick={linkTo('Button', 'second')}>Go to \"Second\"</button>;\nexport const second = () => <button onClick={linkTo('Button', 'first')}>Go to \"First\"</button>;\n```\n\nHave a look at the linkTo function:\n\n```js\nimport { linkTo } from '@storybook/addon-links';\n\nlinkTo('Toggle', 'off');\nlinkTo(\n  () => 'Toggle',\n  () => 'off'\n);\nlinkTo('Toggle'); // Links to the first story in the 'Toggle' kind\n```\n\nWith that, you can link an event in a component to any story in the Storybook.\n\n- First parameter is the story kind name (what you named with `title`).\n- Second (optional) parameter is the story name (what you named with `exported name`).\n  If the second parameter is omitted, the link will point to the first story in the given kind.\n\nYou can also pass a function instead for any of above parameter. That function accepts arguments emitted by the event and it should return a string:\n\n```js\nimport { linkTo } from '@storybook/addon-links';\nimport LinkTo from '@storybook/addon-links/react';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Select',\n};\n\nexport const index = () => (\n  <select value=\"Index\" onChange={linkTo('Select', (e) => e.currentTarget.value)}>\n    <option>index</option>\n    <option>first</option>\n    <option>second</option>\n    <option>third</option>\n  </select>\n);\nexport const first = () => <LinkTo story=\"index\">Go back</LinkTo>;\nexport const second = () => <LinkTo story=\"index\">Go back</LinkTo>;\nexport const third = () => <LinkTo story=\"index\">Go back</LinkTo>;\n```\n\n## hrefTo function\n\nIf you want to get an URL for a particular story, you may use `hrefTo` function. It returns a promise, which resolves to string containing a relative URL:\n\n```js\nimport { hrefTo } from '@storybook/addon-links';\nimport { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Href',\n};\n\nexport const log = () => {\n  hrefTo('Href', 'log').then(action('URL of this story'));\n\n  return <span>See action logger</span>;\n};\n```\n\n## withLinks decorator\n\n`withLinks` decorator enables a declarative way of defining story links, using data attributes.\nHere is an example in React, but it works with any framework:\n\n```js\nimport { withLinks } from '@storybook/addon-links';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Button',\n  decorators: [withLinks],\n};\n\nexport const first = () => (\n  <button data-sb-kind=\"OtherKind\" data-sb-story=\"otherStory\">\n    Go to \"OtherStory\"\n  </button>\n);\n```\n\n## LinkTo component (React only)\n\nOne possible way of using `hrefTo` is to create a component that uses native `a` element, but prevents page reloads on plain left click, so that one can still use default browser methods to open link in new tab.\nA React implementation of such a component can be imported from `@storybook/addon-links` package:\n\n```js\nimport LinkTo from '@storybook/addon-links/react';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Link',\n};\n\nexport const first = () => <LinkTo story=\"second\">Go to Second</LinkTo>;\nexport const second = () => <LinkTo story=\"first\">Go to First</LinkTo>;\n```\n\nIt accepts all the props the `a` element does, plus `story` and `kind`. It the `kind` prop is omitted, the current kind will be preserved.\n\n```js\n<LinkTo\n  kind=\"Toggle\"\n  story=\"off\"\n  target=\"_blank\"\n  title=\"link to second story\"\n  style={{ color: '#1474f3' }}\n>\n  Go to Second\n</LinkTo>\n```\n\nTo implement such a component for another framework, you need to add special handling for `click` event on native `a` element. See [`RoutedLink` sources](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/addons/links/src/react/components/RoutedLink.tsx) for reference.\n"},{"name":"@storybook/blocks@8.0.4","repository":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook","license":"MIT","licenseText":"# Storybook Doc Blocks\n\nPortable documentation components for building design systems in Storybook.\n\n## Blocks development\n\nTo bootstrap, in the monorepo root:\n\n```sh\nyarn start\n```\n\nTo develop this package, in the monorepo root:\n\n```sh\nyarn build blocks --watch\n```\n\nTo run storybook, in this directory:\n\n```sh\nyarn storybook\n```\n"},{"name":"@storybook/svelte@8.0.4","repository":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook","license":"MIT","licenseText":"# Storybook Svelte renderer\n"},{"name":"@storybook/sveltekit@8.0.4","repository":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook","license":"MIT","licenseText":"# Storybook for SvelteKit\n\nSee [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/8.0/get-started/sveltekit?renderer=svelte) for installation instructions, usage examples, APIs, and more.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nIntegrating with SvelteKit would not have been possible if it weren't for the fantastic efforts by the Svelte core team - especially [Ben McCann](https://twitter.com/benjaminmccann) - to make integrations with the wider ecosystem possible.\nA big thank you also goes out to [Paolo Ricciuti](https://twitter.com/PaoloRicciuti) for improving the mocking capabilities.\n"},{"name":"@storybook/test@8.0.4","repository":"https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook","license":"MIT","licenseText":"# Storybook Test\n\nThe `@storybook/test` package contains utilities for testing your stories inside `play` functions.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the package by adding the `@storybook/test` dev dependency:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -D @storybook/test\npnpm add -D @storybook/test\nyarn add -D @storybook/test\n```\n\nNote that this package is not an addon, so you don't have to add it to your `main.js/main.ts` file.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe test package exports instrumented versions of [@vitest/spy](https://vitest.dev/api/mock.html), [@vitest/expect](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html) (based on [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)), [@testing-library/dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro) and [@testing-library/user-event](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro).\nThe instrumentation makes sure you can debug those methods in the [addon-interactions](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-interactions) panel.\n\n```ts\n// Button.stories.ts\nimport { Button } from './Button';\nimport { within, userEvent, expect, fn } from '@storybook/test';\n\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n  args: {\n    onClick: fn(),\n  },\n};\n\nexport const Demo = {\n  play: async ({ args, canvasElement }) => {\n    const canvas = within(canvasElement);\n    await userEvent.click(canvas.getByRole('button'));\n    await expect(args.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  },\n};\n```\n"},{"name":"@sveltejs/adapter-auto@3.1.1","repository":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit","license":"MIT","licenseText":"Copyright (c) 2020 [these people](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/graphs/contributors)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It is used for building applications for Desktop Computers using a combination of Rust tools and HTML rendered in a Webview. Apps built with Tauri can ship with any number of pieces of an optional JS API / Rust API so that webviews can control the system via message passing. In fact, developers can extend the default API with their own functionality and bridge the Webview and Rust-based backend easily.\n\nTauri apps can have custom menus and have tray-type interfaces. They can be updated, and are managed by the user's operating system as expected. They are very small, because they use the system's webview. They do not ship a runtime, since the final binary is compiled from rust. This makes the reversing of Tauri apps not a trivial task.\n\n## This module\n\nThis is a typescript library that creates `cjs` and `esm` JavaScript endpoints for you to import into your Frontend framework so that the Webview can call and listen to backend activity. We also ship the pure typescript, because for some frameworks this is more optimal. It uses the message passing of webviews to their hosts.\n\nTo learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe preferred method is to install this module locally as a dependency:\n\n```\n$ npm install --save @tauri-apps/api\n$ yarn add @tauri-apps/api\n```\n\n## Semver\n\n**tauri** is following [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/).\n\n## Licenses\n\nCode: (c) 2019 - 2021 - The Tauri Programme within The Commons Conservancy.\n\nMIT or MIT/Apache 2.0 where applicable.\n\nLogo: CC-BY-NC-ND\n\n- Original Tauri Logo Designs by [Daniel Thompson-Yvetot](https://github.com/nothingismagick) and [Guillaume Chau](https://github.com/akryum)\n"},{"name":"@tauri-apps/cli@1.5.11","repository":"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri","license":"Apache-2.0 OR MIT","licenseText":"# @tauri-apps/cli\n <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/raw/dev/app-icon.png\" height=\"128\" width=\"128\">\n\n[![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-blue.svg)](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT%20or%20Apache%202-green.svg)](https://opencollective.com/tauri)\n[![test cli](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/tauri-apps/tauri/test-cli-js.yml?label=test%20cli&logo=github)](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/actions/workflows/test-cli-js.yml)\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Ftauri-apps%2Ftauri.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Ftauri-apps%2Ftauri?ref=badge_shield)\n[![Chat Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-discord-7289da.svg)](https://discord.gg/SpmNs4S)\n[![website](https://img.shields.io/badge/website-tauri.app-purple.svg)](https://tauri.app)\n[![https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation/assets/images/badge.svg](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation/assets/images/badge.svg)](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation)\n[![support](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsor-Open%20Collective-blue.svg)](https://opencollective.com/tauri)\n\n| Component | Version                                     |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| @tauri-apps/cli   | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tauri-apps/cli.svg) |\n\n## About Tauri\nTauri is a polyglot and generic system that is very composable and allows engineers to make a wide variety of applications. It is used for building applications for Desktop Computers using a combination of Rust tools and HTML rendered in a Webview. Apps built with Tauri can ship with any number of pieces of an optional JS API / Rust API so that webviews can control the system via message passing. In fact, developers can extend the default API with their own functionality and bridge the Webview and Rust-based backend easily.\n\nTauri apps can have custom menus and have tray-type interfaces. They can be updated, and are managed by the user's operating system as expected. They are very small, because they use the system's webview. They do not ship a runtime, since the final binary is compiled from rust. This makes the reversing of Tauri apps not a trivial task.\n## This module\nWritten in Typescript and packaged such that it can be used with `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, and `bun`, this library provides a node.js runner for common tasks when using Tauri, like `yarn tauri dev`. For the most part it is a wrapper around [tauri-cli](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/tooling/cli).\n\nTo learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe preferred method is to install this module locally as a development dependency:\n```\n$ npm install --save-dev @tauri-apps/cli\n$ yarn add --dev @tauri-apps/cli\n```\n\n## Semver\n**tauri** is following [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/).\n## Licenses\nCode: (c) 2019 - 2021 - The Tauri Programme within The Commons Conservancy.\n\nMIT or MIT/Apache 2.0 where applicable.\n\nLogo: CC-BY-NC-ND\n- Original Tauri Logo Designs by [Daniel Thompson-Yvetot](https://github.com/nothingismagick) and [Guillaume Chau](https://github.com/akryum)\n"},{"name":"@tsconfig/svelte@5.0.3","repository":"https://github.com/tsconfig/bases","license":"MIT","licenseText":"MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\r\n> \r\n> 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n> \r\n> 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n> \r\n> You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n> \r\n> You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\r\n> \r\n> You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\r\n> \r\n> If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n> \r\n> 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n> \r\n> 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n> \r\n> 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n> \r\n> 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n> \r\n> 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n> \r\n> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n### unherit@v1.1.3\n\n> Clone a constructor without affecting the super-class\n\nLicense: MIT\nAuthor: Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com> (https://wooorm.com)\nContributors:\n - Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com> (https://wooorm.com)\n\n> (The MIT License)\n>\n> Copyright (c) 2015 Titus Wormer <tituswormer@gmail.com>\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n> IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n      \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n   2.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
